00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,040
welcome everybody to this episode of the

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,960
women in technology spotlight today i

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,800
have with me jillian augustine with the

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,640
data scientists at monday

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
she's also a speaker at we are

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,119
developers

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,800
women in data science and also big data

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,640
in london

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,800
welcome jillian hi hey

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
so nice to have you with me jillian i

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
would like our

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,360
listeners viewers to get to know you a

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
little bit better

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
maybe you could tell me a little bit

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,480
about yourself

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,680
sure um so my name is jillian

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,000
i'm from the uk so

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
um i've been in i've been living in

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
vienna since 2013.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,039
um i'm from the uk um and my family is

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,239
originally from grenada in the caribbean

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
so pretty international um journey to

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,000
here

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,080
um and um

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
yeah i've been working in data science

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
now for

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,360
um since 2018 um and

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,520
it's it's currently pretty fun

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
uh you have a very international

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
background as you said what made you

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,000
move to

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,119
austria sure so um i actually

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,680
i did my phd at the vienna bio center so

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,640
my phd was in molecular biology

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
um and the vienna bio center is a really

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,400
good phd program

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
so this was the main reason that i moved

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
um

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,240
that i moved to vienna i was previously

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,520
in canada as well briefly so i

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,119
studied at mcgill university for my um a

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,720
part of my undergrad

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,119
um as well but um after being at mcgill

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
um in montreal for one year which is

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,719
great and it's a great city

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
i decided this time i would probably

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
stay in europe because everything's a

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
bit closer together

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,439
i think it's so cool that you say that

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,920
the

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
program at the bio center is such a good

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
one that you actually heard about it in

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
the uk which

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
i'm a bit stoked about that because i

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,480
myself i have a phd from the university

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
uh vienna in chemistry and my uh major

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,800
was biochemistry

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
i did then do my phd in theoretical

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
chemistry but still i

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,599
spent a lot of time there so i'm glad

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
that the reputation

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
of the institute is still there my

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
bachelor's was actually

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
in biochemistry so i see myself more as

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
a biochemist

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,120
than a biologist but um it's kind of in

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
the middle

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
that's such an interesting coincidence

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,800
because there aren't actually that many

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,080
people with the background like ours

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,920
yeah no so cool so

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
which me this means that you were

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,840
actually a natural scientist before you

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
became a woman in i.t

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
tell me a little bit about your

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
educational background what schools did

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
you go to

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,319
why did you choose this path what did

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,440
you find interesting

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,640
um my path is a bit

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,599
um i would call it a zigzag almost

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,080
so if i i think back to when i first

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,120
went to university 2007

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,480
i actually started studying dietetics

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,760
which is similar to medical nutrition

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,760
um and then um during this course

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
there were some biochemistry courses and

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
i found that i actually like the

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,720
biochemistry courses more than the other

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,799
ones

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,159
so my first university was coventry

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,159
university in the uk

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
and then i went to leeds university to

94
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
study biochemistry

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,400
and then after a couple of years i had

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
the opportunity to

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
study abroad so i spent a whole year in

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,040
at mcgill university in canada

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,959
which was a great experience and really

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,640
made me want to um to stay abroad

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,760
and so there i focus mainly on biology

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,519
developmental biology and also

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,439
a bit of french as well why not um

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,920
and then um after so i

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
i found out about development biology

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,720
when i was there

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,799
i really found it interesting so i

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
so after i finished my bachelor's degree

109
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,040
in leeds i decided to start a phd at the

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,720
vienna biocenter

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
so i initially started in a

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
group which studied developmental

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
biology because it's such a fascinating

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
field

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
but then this didn't turn out really to

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
be the best match for me so then i

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
changed and i decided to go back towards

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,000
biochemistry

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
um so i started my phd again and just

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
one year later

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,960
and um yeah that was in a more

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
biochemical focus looking at um the

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,840
interactions of different

124
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,040
proteins in the cell during different

125
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,800
conditions um

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,840
and during that time i

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,960
had some introductory courses to r

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,320
and um when i think about

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,919
how i got into data science

130
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,560
um during my phd i

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,919
i must say i watched a lot of really bad

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
presentations

133
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
so ones where maybe someone says oh you

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
can clearly see

135
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
this but the whole audience is

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
completely lost

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
so i became really really enthusiastic

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
about

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
doing good data visualizations and

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,919
telling stories

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
um using data in a really good way so in

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,240
a really clear way

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,320
in an understandable way um

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
and then i think pretty much from there

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,759
this was

146
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,400
this was kind of the bridge to

147
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,520
data science because my my passion

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,759
really lies in telling stories with data

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
and learning from data and finding out

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,639
what data can

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,280
tell us this is wonderful because

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
i feel this deeply bad presentations and

153
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,639
you know

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
information being conveyed in a way that

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
nobody can actually use it

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,039
it's a big problem in science and i love

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
that you took this approach and that

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,560
made you look at

159
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
uh how to visualize data i think this is

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,520
a big

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
thing data is not information i think

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,400
it's just data

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
and what you do with it makes it

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,759
information so

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,919
i i understand that this is what

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,919
fascinates you making

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,240
data accessible and turning it into

168
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,039
information

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
so when you became a data scientist um

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,160
what was your first step after you

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,840
and you did your phd yeah so i was

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,199
i was very fortunate to um

173
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,759
i applied to the a1 graduate scheme

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
and i was fortunate enough to get a

175
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,120
place there so i would become an

176
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,400
a1 graduate in ai and data analytics

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,800
and this fit because throughout my phd

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
and

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
also before that i had been doing data

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,440
analysis on

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,880
a regular basis so this really

182
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,800
and this p um this graduate program

183
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,400
really allowed me to gain a better

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
knowledge of business

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
so what all the different um

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
abbreviations mean

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,560
what is important for stakeholders

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,120
and to understand how how data analytics

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
fits into the wider scheme of the

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000
business

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
i was not aware that anyone had a

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
graduate program that's such a cool

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,720
thing we have one at vmware 2 and i feel

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,440
that

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
this is such a good way to move into the

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,840
workplace from from

197
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,400
education what exactly what kind of data

198
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,479
does or did you work with that e1 was it

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
more in terms of marketing or was it

200
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,199
more in

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
product development or what was the

202
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
background

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,639
so there were two main um

204
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,000
two main projects which i worked on the

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,199
first one looked at

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,120
um understanding customer satisfaction

207
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,360
so um one widely used metric is the net

208
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
promoter score so if you ever get a

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,599
recommendation after you you use a

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
service saying how likely are you to

211
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,160
recommend

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
this to somebody else this is this is

213
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
this score

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,720
um so one one main

215
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,759
project that i was working on looked at

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
the data

217
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
from different and from many different

218
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,199
customers

219
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
and try to understand what are the

220
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,720
drivers for someone

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
being likely to recommend the service or

222
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,640
not

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
and the second um the second one that i

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
looked at was more

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,479
um on the so not on the customer facing

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
side although it did have effects

227
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,680
naturally for the customers which was

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,440
looking at the networks um so trying to

229
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,240
predict the outages

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
of um different parts of the network and

231
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
trying to

232
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
um that wasn't only in the initial

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,279
stages but trying to

234
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,680
set things up so that conclusions could

235
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,560
be made in the future in terms of

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
when is a breakage of a cable likely to

237
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,360
happen

238
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,440
where is it likely to happen and and

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
that was all in the context of then

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,279
allowing

241
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,440
um allowing the cables to get repaired

242
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,560
as soon as possible if you have an idea

243
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,720
of where issues might come up okay

244
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,480
that sounds so interesting um did you

245
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,200
also include data from

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
sensors in in the network or did you

247
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
just

248
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,519
take the data of outages and then cable

249
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,399
breakages from the historic data

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
so in this case it was it was just um

251
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,040
looking at the outages and

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
looking at um where they were happening

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,360
uh when you compare

254
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,160
your work with data in the academic

255
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,279
space and

256
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,320
in a1 was there a difference in in the

257
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,600
way you

258
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
data was approached i think that in the

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,160
academic space

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,839
data is so in the stem

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,440
space at least data is way more valued

262
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,240
so um kind of the

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
you you work to let the data speak for

264
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,279
itself

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,640
and what what the data says is the truth

266
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,760
um and you make decisions based on the

267
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
data

268
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,680
um whereas i feel um in the

269
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
in the corporate space or in the private

270
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
sector

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,640
there are way more influencing factors

272
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,800
which come into play and way more things

273
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,440
that you have to take into consideration

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
before you make a decision so i i would

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
say

276
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,320
in academia the decisions are more

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
data-driven than

278
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
in the corporate world yeah i understand

279
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,480
so

280
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,800
um i feel that that science is more

281
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
occupied with going where the data leads

282
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
you and

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,920
corporate space might be more give me

284
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
the data that i need to do what i want

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
to do

286
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,560
yeah maybe although even even in

287
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,120
academia it can be unfortunate and i

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
think it's

289
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,560
kind of a reflection of the

290
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,760
circumstances um

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,760
sometimes you

292
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,440
it's known that people can pick and

293
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,040
choose the data that they want to

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
support their theories

295
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
but generally i think overall there is

296
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
um

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
there is a much better appreciation for

298
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,079
the value

299
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,680
of data in higher end i want to make a

300
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,839
little bit of a step back

301
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
so i was wondering if you have a family

302
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,079
with a background in stem

303
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
did they support you what do you have

304
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,920
brothers and sisters maybe who do

305
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,839
something similar or not

306
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,440
um so my sister is an optometrist

307
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,040
so this is also science related

308
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,240
and my my mum was a dental nurse

309
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,120
and then a health service manager

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,000
so again in the medical field so we've

311
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
always kind of

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
been on this side of um um

313
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,160
yeah on this side of the balance i would

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,200
say and and obviously since your mother

315
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
was also

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
in that she wasn't surprised when you

317
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
chose the career because you know i've

318
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
talked to other women where the family

319
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
was surprised by the choice of opiate

320
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
but

321
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,399
i guess that was not the case in your um

322
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,480
i would say um because i initially

323
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
started with dietetics which is very

324
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,120
medical

325
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,639
um because i think that was kind of um

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,240
what what was known to me so um

327
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,160
kind of when you think of the careers

328
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
that you can go for

329
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,360
anything in the hospital i pretty new

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,079
was

331
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
i i pretty much knew was was accessible

332
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,680
also because

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
um i lived pretty close to the hospital

334
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
and

335
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,160
and my mom worked there so i spent a lot

336
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
of time just

337
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:50,399
in the offices of the hospital um

338
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:52,880
but it i think after after dietetics

339
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
and then when i switch to biochemistry i

340
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,760
think biochemistry is different

341
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,399
because it's not related to a profession

342
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
and i do think i was one of the first

343
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,720
people

344
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
i know to do some sort of education

345
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
which was not specifically

346
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,560
related to a profession um so

347
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,320
i think um my family and when i think of

348
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
my family i think of like extended

349
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,240
family

350
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,279
aunts uncles and godparents and so

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,320
um they kind of

352
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
check in to see if if i'm okay if i if

353
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,519
everything's going okay

354
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,720
um but i wouldn't say they really know

355
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,120
what i'm i'm doing but they

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
as long as i say i'm okay then it's fine

357
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
for them

358
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
uh you touched on two really different

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
things uh see

360
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,160
and very interesting things here because

361
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,800
um one is

362
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
is that that was a role that was known

363
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
to you

364
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,120
you know nutritionists and i think

365
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,120
that's a very important

366
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,800
thing to look at what kind of

367
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,880
roles are available to us as women or as

368
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
even as men you know there's this this

369
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
kind of occupations we know

370
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
and then there's all this this entire

371
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
field where we have never

372
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
met anyone seen anyone do it and i think

373
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
that's a big

374
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
issue because we might have talents that

375
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,199
are in a completely different

376
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,959
field but um i was thinking about this

377
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,199
recently uh because i was writing

378
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
a short article and i remembered what

379
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,800
hannibal lecter said in the silence of

380
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,360
the lambs and when he said

381
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,399
how do we begin to covet we covered what

382
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
we see

383
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
you know so yeah and i think this is a

384
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,480
big thing and and

385
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,720
something i think we might touch on when

386
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,839
we look at the education of

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,920
women children what kind of roles we

388
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,240
we offer to them what we show them what

389
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
they can do and the other thing is

390
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
i'm not sure if it's related to your

391
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,160
caribbean background but for

392
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,320
my family since my i grew up in africa

393
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,720
and my father is from nigeria

394
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,360
it was they also had this this thing

395
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
about

396
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,920
um jobs with educations with clear

397
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
outcomes like buckthorn

398
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,839
you know those are the things you would

399
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,360
do and i do feel that my father

400
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,959
always wondered what biochemistry

401
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
actually was and now

402
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,880
that i'm at mit he doesn't really know

403
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,519
what i'm doing

404
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,519
so yeah pretty much saying

405
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,440
okay um yeah interesting point around

406
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
being a role model how did you

407
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,680
experience being a woman

408
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,519
in in i.t especially since it's also not

409
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,639
only a woman in a tea you also went to a

410
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,040
strange country

411
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,040
and then how is this for you in terms of

412
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
like generally when we think about role

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
models we

414
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,199
are thinking about people who are like

415
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,920
us who

416
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,120
have done what we we want to do and then

417
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,320
we can kind of

418
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,800
follow in their footsteps um in that

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,519
sense

420
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,600
i i don't have anybody who is my

421
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,959
role model i mean there are many people

422
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,240
who i aspire to in

423
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,120
in various different ways um definitely

424
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
and there are many people who i i can

425
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,199
kind of look up

426
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,639
to and think i want to do what they are

427
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,240
doing um

428
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,560
but it's always very intangible still

429
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
so i still feel i'm kind of the first

430
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,040
one going the steps

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,720
and and seeing what happens

432
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,399
i i can imagine and which gives you the

433
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
opportunity to be a role model for

434
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
others who come after you which is cool

435
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
also

436
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,920
um but it's always more difficult being

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
the first then i think it takes a

438
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,480
certain kind of character to

439
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,759
to actually do that as from one and very

440
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
centered because

441
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,199
you have to be very clear in what you

442
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,279
actually want to achieve

443
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
which brings me to my next question what

444
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,880
kind of goals do you have

445
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,440
i mean you enjoy working with data

446
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,519
obviously but do you have anything

447
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
in terms of career path that you have as

448
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,720
a goal

449
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,839
um now i kind of

450
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,639
um i kind of have a rule to myself

451
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,039
which is to create a plan but don't

452
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,720
expect things to go to plan

453
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,760
um and i think it's because um

454
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,240
up until my so

455
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
in my bachelor's and even before when i

456
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,360
was at

457
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,880
um college and school kind of if you

458
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,240
work hard then

459
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,439
then you get good results coming out um

460
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,520
and then ac it's quite easy to have a

461
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,720
plan of i will do this and then

462
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,559
do this and do this um but then

463
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:40,320
i think um when i had to restart my phd

464
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,400
um here then i realized like

465
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,000
you can be you can be really good at

466
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
what you're doing but sometimes things

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,520
just don't go to plan

468
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,440
and then this is why now i

469
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
i my goal is to keep enjoying what i'm

470
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,200
doing

471
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,799
i would say so my goal at the moment

472
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,120
i i've been working i've been focusing

473
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,600
my efforts on visualization for

474
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,720
and data analytics in terms of coding

475
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,480
and this kind of thing

476
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,320
i've been focusing on this for at least

477
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
four years and i'm still really

478
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,120
enthusiastic about it

479
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,760
um so this is kind of my goal

480
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,080
um but i know i have a range of skills

481
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,600
so

482
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,280
not only on the coding side and

483
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,799
going towards the software development

484
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,960
side but also on the communication side

485
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
and and creating links between

486
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
businesses

487
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,720
and more technical people who maybe um

488
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,240
cannot express what they want to say so

489
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
so well so i i feel like i have a range

490
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,400
of

491
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,600
tools on my belt and at the moment i'm

492
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
i'm focusing more on developing my

493
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,919
software

494
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,400
development skills um because this is

495
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,799
where my interest lies right now but i

496
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,559
don't

497
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,400
necessarily have an aim

498
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,880
i just want to keep enjoying what i'm

499
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,760
doing that's cool

500
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
um and i think that's an important part

501
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,039
i mean

502
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,720
a job like like yours means that you

503
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,720
have to stay on top of the technology

504
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
and the developments and in the field

505
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
and all that

506
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
and that is easier if you actually enjoy

507
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
what you're doing so passion and

508
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,120
enthusiasm for what you do is a big

509
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,720
thing i feel right

510
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,440
yeah definitely yeah so in terms of work

511
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,559
environment

512
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,120
um i since this is women in technology

513
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,640
um do you have a lot of women you work

514
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,000
with or is it more men

515
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,799
what what's it like so in

516
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
our team at the moment they're we're

517
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,440
split into

518
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
project managers and then data

519
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,200
scientists and i would say

520
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,880
um on the project management side

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,360
it's uh strongly women

522
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
and i would say on the data scientist

523
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,480
side it's strongly men

524
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,159
so for the first year no not first year

525
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,679
for the first six months when i was

526
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
working in my current position

527
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,960
i was the only woman in a data science

528
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
role

529
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,760
um and then my my colleague yelana

530
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,280
milosevic joined

531
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,799
and that was very nice um even though we

532
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,240
don't work together but it was still

533
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,320
it was still nice um and also my

534
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
boss is a woman as well which i really

535
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,799
appreciate

536
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,640
so um i think it

537
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,159
and she's also a very technical person

538
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,200
as well so

539
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,559
i even though on a daily basis

540
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,600
i never work with technical women

541
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,240
really um it's

542
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,360
nice to know that they are there because

543
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,840
i think the

544
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,159
diversity in teams like this is

545
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,320
important

546
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,440
i tend to agree but i would like to ask

547
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
why did you

548
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,960
feel that it is nice for her to come on

549
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,799
board what difference did

550
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,240
you feel um i think

551
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,280
um when

552
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,120
i think when a team is too homogenous

553
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,320
um then um

554
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,240
some some ways can

555
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
some ways or beings can be a bit

556
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,960
exclusive rather than inclusive

557
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
so i think the more that there are

558
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
different

559
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,120
there are clearly different groups of

560
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
people together the more

561
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,280
um the more inclusive it can be and this

562
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,720
also goes in the sense

563
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,159
um of in our team we have some people

564
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
who are more chatty

565
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,080
and then some people who are more quiet

566
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,280
or prefer to work by themselves

567
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,480
and i i think like if you were if it

568
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,640
were 90

569
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
chatty then the quiet person would not

570
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
feel so included

571
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,440
if it were 90 quiet then the chatty

572
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,880
person would not feel so

573
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,919
included so i think having having this

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,360
um diversity really allows

575
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,520
each um each group of people to feel

576
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
more comfortable

577
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,280
that is a very good insight it's not

578
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,880
about having someone who is completely

579
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,480
like you it's about having many

580
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
different people so everyone can beat

581
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
themselves

582
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
themselves i think yeah you put it in

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,960
english yeah

584
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,480
um yeah and i feel that you're also

585
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,280
doing a lot to make the

586
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,000
i.t more diverse by giving all these

587
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,000
talks that for example for women

588
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,080
are developed female developers so what

589
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
i'm sorry i forgot the name of the group

590
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,720
but women in data science and

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
and we are developers sorry and yeah

592
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
things like that

593
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
um what made you start doing these

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
things

595
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,520
i think i

596
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,320
like during my phd time we

597
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,200
we had this thing called um uh monday

598
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
seminar

599
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
where once a year you would have to

600
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,200
present your results to

601
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,720
the rest of the campus and then this

602
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,760
really

603
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
gave me practice in presenting things

604
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,679
and

605
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,280
telling stories and um

606
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,320
i suppose because i because

607
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,440
i've been in the audience so many times

608
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,720
and really

609
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,640
just being completely lost and

610
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,720
so it's really important for me that

611
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
presentations are good

612
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
um good and they are understandable so

613
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,240
um

614
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
this is why i also like to do them

615
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,840
because

616
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,880
i think it's important that people can

617
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,000
um

618
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
understand what's being said and also i

619
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,280
think

620
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,120
sometimes if there is a complicated

621
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,679
presentation

622
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,000
sometimes people think so a person in

623
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,720
the audience might think that they are

624
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
too stupid to understand what's what the

625
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
topic is and it

626
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,799
it's not the case at all um it is the

627
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,559
responsibility of the person presenting

628
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,400
to make sure that

629
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,960
their message is clear and um and i

630
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,279
think

631
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,000
i have presented in the past when you

632
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,000
see people

633
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,600
it's really nice to see when people get

634
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
it

635
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,440
whilst you're presenting they understand

636
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
what you're talking about

637
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,760
and then i also get good feedback

638
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
afterwards because people

639
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
say that they really liked how i did

640
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,400
this thing or

641
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,440
i made it understandable and they never

642
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
realized

643
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,679
that two things were linked in the way

644
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,720
that i explained them

645
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,000
um and and i think getting

646
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,960
good feedback from people is kind of um

647
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
always a good motivation to continue i

648
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,640
love how you talked about

649
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,919
that it's um the responsibility of the

650
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,600
presenter to make

651
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,919
people understand what you're talking

652
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,240
about and i also feel so important

653
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,559
because what you have

654
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
observed i've also seen you know people

655
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,760
obviously don't know what you're talking

656
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,279
about but they don't ask

657
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,880
because the problem is aggravated

658
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,400
because nobody seems to really

659
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,000
understands but nobody wants to be the

660
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
first to ask a question so you have

661
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
these bad presentations and you have the

662
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,279
audience that just sits there and stares

663
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,799
at you and um

664
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,960
yeah this is something we definitely

665
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,159
need to address and i think

666
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,440
what you do also helps um people feel

667
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,679
more comfortable

668
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,279
with actually being in that field

669
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,720
because they you know this moment where

670
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
you understand something is the moment

671
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,799
where you feel you can do it too

672
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,440
you know so yeah thank you for for

673
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,880
looking at this this issue

674
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,880
um so you

675
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,440
had a kind of um common path into i.t

676
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,200
being a natural scientist and and then

677
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,679
moving into i.t

678
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,039
but if you were a young woman and you

679
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,400
were starting out now

680
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,559
to to get um on this career journey what

681
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
would you want what would you have

682
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,720
wanted to know at the beginning or what

683
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
recommendations would you give to a

684
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,000
young woman starting out

685
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:52,240
or a girl in school this is

686
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,559
interesting um so one thing

687
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,080
you mentioned a girl in school and that

688
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,799
reminds me

689
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,520
of kind of a reason i think my path was

690
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,480
a bit

691
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,279
like not direct and zigzagged because in

692
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,559
the uk

693
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,039
you can you choose you study 11 subjects

694
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,720
up until the age of 16 and then you only

695
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,840
study four

696
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,799
from 16 to 18 and then

697
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,080
um and then at university you generally

698
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,520
just study one

699
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,480
and um what's more the 11 subjects that

700
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,960
you choose

701
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,039
to finish when you're 16 you choose them

702
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,080
when you're 13.

703
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,400
so there is really really narrow

704
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,400
in terms of what you can study um

705
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,559
because yeah pretty much if you don't

706
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,880
study

707
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,200
if you don't choose to study geography

708
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,240
when you are 13 years old you cannot

709
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,159
study it at university which is crazy

710
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,120
because you're 13 years old how do you

711
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,159
know um

712
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,640
so um

713
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,600
one one interesting thing when i was

714
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,120
thinking about

715
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,559
um what i chose to study

716
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,440
is that i when i was 13 i chose to study

717
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,240
french and then when i was

718
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
16 i chose to continue studying french

719
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,200
and

720
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,039
then actually i ended up in montreal

721
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
where my french got really

722
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,559
good and then it was the first time i

723
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,880
was actually in france which

724
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,720
was after i was in montreal because i'd

725
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,919
never been to france before

726
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,720
um but i just think and

727
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
i just say that because i studied french

728
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,440
because

729
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,200
i liked it not because i was the best at

730
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,840
it but because i'd like to end

731
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,480
and that kind of led me to montreal and

732
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,799
then

733
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,320
kind of led me where i am now so i

734
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,120
really

735
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,640
i really think you should study what you

736
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,679
want to study

737
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,559
you study not it's not always

738
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,679
about studying what you are the best at

739
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,880
but study

740
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,840
what is fun i think that's really

741
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,960
important

742
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,559
um and um yeah and

743
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,520
i i think i was very fortunate

744
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,399
looking back because i didn't have

745
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,240
anybody who directly told me to my face

746
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,520
that i couldn't do something

747
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
yeah and that doesn't mean that

748
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,039
representation isn't important because i

749
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,640
never aspired to be

750
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,279
many things because i just didn't know

751
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,600
they existed but i was very fortunate

752
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,640
that i didn't have people around me who

753
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,799
were

754
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,440
too insecure in themselves and then

755
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
decided to try and limit my

756
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,320
possibilities because of this

757
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,200
um but i think now in

758
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,799
in the digital age so that there is a

759
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
lot more

760
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,159
so many more resources on the internet

761
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
and so many

762
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,880
websites you can read that people where

763
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,960
people create blogs and stuff like this

764
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
i would definitely give the advice to a

765
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,679
younger person that

766
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,120
um if you want to do something

767
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,159
um you can look into it you can find the

768
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
people

769
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,600
online you can find the websites online

770
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
to

771
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
to learn different things and to know to

772
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,559
learn different tips

773
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,240
and i think that's definitely um the way

774
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,520
to go is to do what is

775
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,720
is fun and do what you want very true

776
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,279
thank you you touched on

777
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,919
on one very specific thing in the

778
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,720
beginning which i also find

779
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
detrimental to to young people is

780
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
limiting

781
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
you know their exposure to certain

782
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,919
topics and information

783
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,360
so i feel one thing we should look at

784
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
and that's obviously not ours

785
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,120
a thing to do but definitely the

786
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,279
education system should be as broad as

787
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,600
possible so everybody gets a chance to

788
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,320
to dabble in different topics and look

789
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,720
at them

790
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
because obviously 13 years is much too

791
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,279
young to actually decide whether you

792
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,240
will like something

793
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,640
in the future or not i actually when i

794
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,159
was 13 i i chose german

795
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,440
i i chose i think i chose french

796
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,440
no when i was 12 i could choose between

797
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,520
german and spanish and i chose german

798
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,760
because then i got to visit germany

799
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,720
and then when i was 13 i decided to go

800
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,080
for french but now i'm fluent in both so

801
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,760
um it worked its way out yeah

802
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,440
luckily yeah but you never know right

803
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,679
where life will take you if it will

804
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,240
exactly french or something completely

805
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,919
different that will be useful you know

806
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,279
and then the second thing that makes me

807
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,960
thoughtful is that you said you were

808
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,480
lucky because nobody discouraged you

809
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,399
from doing what you're doing and the

810
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
same is true for me and that is probably

811
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,279
the reason why i

812
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,039
was able to go the path i did but

813
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,399
that's a sad thing actually you know

814
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,080
that you have to be happy

815
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,840
that at least nobody said don't do it

816
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,080
you're not good enough

817
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,760
yeah you didn't and you did don't have

818
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,200
the role models and you don't have the

819
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,760
you know the

820
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
the lift that you might need to go

821
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,960
higher places

822
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,840
i think that's something we can do for

823
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,520
others you know

824
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,960
telling them that they are definitely

825
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,919
good you know good enough

826
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,440
to choose a career in i.t or in science

827
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,480
and they will make it so that's

828
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,840
something i

829
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,159
i feel we should all try to do and

830
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,760
