  <p>I am software developer, data consultant, speaker, and engineering manager. I am currently Team Lead for Insights
    at <a href="https://anyline.com/">Anyline</a> where, together with my team, I manage the data platform and the
    insights generated from it.
    <br>
    Using data to create value and answer questions is a key interest of mine and a driver of the work I do. My approach
    when working with data is to use the tools that get the job done, independent of programming language, cloud
    provider or other tooling. This allows me to take a flexible approach to solution design and development.
