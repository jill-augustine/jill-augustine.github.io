welcome everybody to this episode of the women in technology spotlight today I have with me Jillian Augustine with the data scientist at mondi. she's also a speaker at WeAreDevelopers, Women in Data Science and also Big Data London. welcome Jillian.
hi.
hey so nice to have you with me Jillian. I would like our listeners viewers to get to know you a little bit better. maybe you could tell me a little bit about yourself?
sure so my name is Jillian I'm from the UK so I've been in I've been living in Vienna since 2013. I'm from the UK and my family is originally from Grenada in the Caribbean so pretty international journey to here and yeah I've been working in data science now for since 2018 and it's currently pretty fun.
you have a very international background as you said. what made you move to Austria?
so I actually I did my phd at the Vienna bio center. my phd was in molecular biology and the Vienna bio center is a really good phd program so this was the main reason that I moved that I moved to Vienna. I was previously in Canada as well briefly so I studied at McGill university for my a part of my undergrad as well. but after being at McGill in montreal for one year, which is great and it's a great city, I decided this time I would probably stay in Europe because everything's a bit closer together.
I think it's so cool that you say that the program at the bio center is such a good one that you actually heard about it in the UK. I'm a bit stoked about that because I myself I have a phd from the university of Vienna in chemistry and my major was biochemistry. I did then do my phd in theoretical chemistry but still I spent a lot of time there so I'm glad that the reputation of the institute is still there.
my bachelor's was actually in biochemistry so I see myself more as a biochemist than a biologist but it's kind of in the middle.
that's such an interesting coincidence because there aren't actually that many people with the background like ours. so cool so this means that you were actually a natural scientist before you became a woman in I.T. tell me a little bit about your educational background what schools did you go to why did you choose this path what did you find interesting.
my path is a bit I would call it a zigzag almost. so if I think back to when I first went to university 2007 I actually started studying dietetics which is similar to medical nutrition. and then during this course there were some biochemistry courses and I found that I actually like the biochemistry courses more than the other ones. so my first university was Coventry university in the UK and then I went to Leeds university to study biochemistry. and then after a couple of years I had the opportunity to study abroad so I spent a whole year in at McGill university in Canada which was a great experience and really made me want to to stay abroad. and so there I focused mainly on biology, developmental biology and also a bit of French as well. why not. so I found out about development biology when I was there I really found it interesting so I so after I finished my bachelor's degree in Leeds I decided to start a phd at the Vienna biocenter. I initially started in a group which studied developmental biology because it's such a fascinating field but then this didn't turn out really to be the best match for me. so then I changed and I decided to go back towards biochemistry so I started my phd again and just one year later. and yeah that was in a more biochemical focus looking at the interactions of different proteins in the cell during different conditions. during that time I had some introductory courses to r and when I think about how I got into data science during my phd I must say I watched a lot of really bad presentations, so ones where maybe someone says "oh you can clearly see this" but the whole audience is completely lost so I became really really enthusiastic about doing good data visualizations and telling stories using data in a really good way, so in a really clear way in an understandable way. and then I think pretty much from there this was this was kind of the bridge to data science because my my passion really lies in telling stories with data. and learning from data and finding out what data can tell us.
this is wonderful because I feel this deeply bad presentations and you know information being conveyed in a way that nobody can actually use it it's a big problem in science and I love that you took this approach and that made you look at how to visualize data. I think this is a big thing data is not information I think it's just data and what you do with it makes it information so I understand that this is what fascinates you making data accessible and turning it into information. so when you became a data scientist what was your first step after you did your phd.
I applied to the a1 graduate scheme and I was fortunate enough to get a place there. so I became an a1 graduate in AI and data analytics. and this fit because throughout my phd and also before that I had been doing data analysis on a regular basis. so this graduate program really allowed me to gain a better knowledge of business. so what all the different abbreviations mean. what is important for stakeholders. and to understand how how data analytics fits into the wider scheme of the business.
I was not aware that a1 had a graduate program. that's such a cool thing we have one at vmware too and I feel that this is such a good way to move into the workplace from education. what kind of data exactly does or did you work with that a1? was it more in terms of marketing or was it more in product development or what was the background?
so there were two main two main projects which I worked on the first one looked at understanding customer satisfaction. one widely used metric is the net promoter score. so if you ever get a recommendation after you use a service saying "how likely are you to recommend this to somebody else", this is this score. so one one main project that I was working on looked at the data from many different customers to try to understand what are the drivers for someone being likely to recommend the service or not. and the second one that I looked at was more on the... so not on the customer facing side, although it did have effects naturally for the customers, which was looking at the networks. so trying to predict the outages of different parts of the network.that was only in the initial stages but trying to set things up so that conclusions could be made in the future in terms of "when is a breakage of a cable likely to happen", "where is it likely to happen" and and that was all in the context of then allowing the cables to get repaired as soon as possible if you have an idea of where issues might come up.
okay that sounds so interesting. did you also include data from sensors in the network or did you just take the data of outages and then cable breakages from the historic data.
in this case it was it was just looking at the outages and looking at where they were happening.
when you compare your work with data in the academic space and in a1, was there a difference in the way you data was approached?
I think that in the academic space data is, so in the stem space at least, data is way more valued. so kind of, you work to let the data speak for itself. what the data says is the truth and you make decisions based on the data. whereas I feel in the in the corporate space or in the private sector there are way more influencing factors which come into play and way more things that you have to take into consideration before you make a decision. so I would say in academia the decisions are more data-driven than in the corporate world.
yeah I understand so I feel that that science is more occupied with going where the data leads you and corporate space might be more give me the data that I need to do what I want to do.
yeah maybe. although even in academia it can be unfortunate, and I think it's kind of a reflection of the circumstances, sometimes it's known that people can pick and choose the data that they want to support their theories. but generally I think overall there is there is a much better appreciation for the value of data.
I want to make a little bit of a step back. so I was wondering if you have a family with a background in stem? did they support you? do you have brothers and sisters maybe who do something similar or not?
my sister is an optometrist. so this is also science related. and my mum was a dental nurse and then a health service manager. so again in the medical field. so we've always kind of been on this side of the balance I would say.
and obviously since your mother was also in that she wasn't surprised when you chose the career because you know, I've talked to other women where the family was surprised by the choice of career but I guess that was not the case for you.
I would say I initially started with dietetics which is very medical because I think that was kind of what what was known to me. so kind of when you think of the careers that you can go for, anything in the hospital pretty much knew was accessible. also because I lived pretty close to the hospital and and my mum worked there so I spent a lot of time just in the offices of the hospital. but I think after dietetics when I switch to biochemistry, I think biochemistry is different because it's not related to a profession. and I do think I was one of the first people I know to do some sort of education which was not specifically related to a profession. so I think my family, and when I think of my family I think of like extended family aunts, uncles and godparents, and so they kind of check in to see if if I'm okay, if everything's going okay but I wouldn't say they really know what I'm doing. but they as long as I say I'm okay then it's fine for them.
you touched on two really different things see and very interesting things here. because one is that that was a role that was known to you. you know nutritionists. and I think that's a very important thing to look at what kind of roles are available to us as women or as even as men you know. there's these kind of occupations we know and then there's all this entire field where we have never met anyone seen anyone do it. and I think that's a big issue because we might have talents that are in a completely different field. but I was thinking about this recently because I was writing a short article and I remembered what hannibal lecter said in the silence of the lambs and when he said how do we begin to covet we covered what we see. you know so yeah and I think this is a big thing and and something I think we might touch on when we look at the education of women, children, what kind of roles we offer to them. what we show them what they can do. and the other thing is I'm not sure if it's related to your Caribbean background but for my family since my I grew up in africa and my father is from nigeria it was they also had this this thing about jobs with educations with clear outcomes. like doctor, lawyer you know those are the things you would do. and I do feel that my father always wondered what biochemistry actually was. and now that I'm in I.T he doesn't really know what I'm doing.
yeah pretty much the same.
okay yeah interesting point around being a role model. how did you experience being a woman in in I.T. especially since it's also not only a woman in I.T you also went to a strange country and then how is this for you?
in terms of like generally when we think about role models we are thinking about people who are like us, who have done what we want to do, and then we can kind of follow in their footsteps. in that sense I don't have anybody who is my role model. I mean there are many people who I aspire to in various different ways, definitely. and there are many people who I can kind of look up to and think I want to do what they are doing. but it's very intangible still so I still feel I'm kind of the first one going the steps and seeing what happens.
I can imagine, and which gives you the opportunity to be a role model for others who come after you, which is cool also. but it's always more difficult being the first then I think it takes a certain kind of character to to actually do that. A strong one and very centered. because you have to be very clear in what you actually want to achieve which brings me to my next question what kind of goals do you have? I mean you enjoy working with data obviously but do you have anything in terms of career path that you have as a goal?
now I kind of have a rule to myself which is to create a plan but don't expect things to go to plan. and I think it's because, in my bachelor's and even before when I was at college and school, kind of if you work hard then then you get good results coming out. and then it's quite easy to have a plan of "I will do this, and then do this, and do this". but then I think when I had to restart my PhD here then I realized like you can be really good at what you're doing but sometimes things just don't go to plan. and then this is why now my goal is to keep enjoying what I'm doing, I would say. so my goal at the moment, I've been working I've been focusing my efforts on visualization and data analytics in terms of coding and this kind of thing. I've been focusing on this for at least four years and I'm still really enthusiastic about it so this is kind of my goal. but I know I have a range of skills so not only on the coding side and going towards the software development side but also on the communication side and and creating links between businesses and more technical people who maybe cannot express what they want to say so well. so I feel like I have a range of tools on my belt and at the moment I'm focusing more on developing my software development skills because this is where my interest lies right now. but I don't necessarily have an aim. I just want to keep enjoying what I'm doing.
that's cool and I think that's an important part. I mean a job like like yours means that you have to stay on top of the technology and the developments and in the field and all that and that is easier if you actually enjoy what you're doing. so passion and enthusiasm for what you do is a big thing I feel.
right yeah definitely yeah.
so in terms of work environment since this is women in technology, do you have a lot of women you work with or is it more men? what what's it like?
so in our team at the moment they're we're split into project managers and then data scientists. and I would say on the project management side it's strongly women and I would say on the data scientist side it's strongly men. so for the first year... not first year, for the first six months when I was working in my current position, I was the only woman in a data science role. And then my colleague yelana Milošević joined and that was very nice even though we don't work together [on projects] but it was still nice. and also my boss is a woman as well which I really appreciate and she's also a very technical person as well. so I even though on a daily basis I never work with technical women really, it's nice to know that they are there because I think the diversity in teams like this is important.
I tend to agree but I would like to ask why did you feel that it is nice for her to come on board? what difference did you feel?
I think when a team is too homogenous then some ways of beings can be a bit exclusive rather than inclusive. so I think the more that there are clearly different groups of people together, the more the more inclusive it can be. and this also goes in the sense of in our team, we have some people who are more chatty and then some people who are more quiet or prefer to work by themselves. and I think if it were 90% chatty then the quiet person would not feel so included. if it were 90% quiet then the chatty person would not feel so included. so I think having this diversity really allows each group of people to feel more comfortable.
that is a very good insight it's not about having someone who is completely like you it's about having many different people so everyone can be themselves. yeah and I feel that you're also doing a lot to make the I.T. more diverse by giving all these talks. for example Women in Data Science and We Are Developers. and yeah things like that. What made you start doing these things?
I think I like during my phd time we had this thing called monday seminar where once a year you would have to present your results to the rest of the campus. and then this really gave me practice in presenting things and telling stories. and I suppose because I because I've been in the audience so many times and really just being completely lost and so it's really important for me that presentations are good, and they are understandable. so this is why I also like to do them because I think it's important that people can understand what's being said. and also I think sometimes if there is a complicated presentation sometimes people or a person in the audience might think that they are too stupid to understand what's what the topic is. and it's not the case at all. it is the responsibility of the person presenting to make sure that their message is clear. and and I think I have presented in the past when you see people... it's really nice to see when people "get it" whilst you're presenting. they understand what you're talking about. and then I also get good feedback afterwards because people say that they really liked how I did this thing or I made it understandable and they never realized that two things were linked in the way that I explained them. and and I think getting good feedback from people is kind of always a good motivation to continue.
I love how you talked about that it's the responsibility of the presenter to make people understand what you're talking about. and I also feel so important because what you have observed, I've also seen. you know people obviously don't know what you're talking about but they don't ask and the problem is aggravated because nobody seems to really understand but nobody wants to be the first to ask a question. so you have these bad presentations and you have the audience that just sits there and stares at you. and yeah this is something we definitely need to address.and I think what you do also helps people feel more comfortable with actually being in that field because they you know this moment where you understand something is the moment where you feel you can do it too you know. so yeah thank you for for looking at this issue. so you had a kind of common path into I.T. being a natural scientist and then moving into I.T. but if you were a young woman and you were starting out now to get on this career journey what would you want what would you have wanted to know at the beginning or what recommendations would you give to a young woman starting out or a girl in school?
this is interesting so one thing you mentioned a girl in school, and that reminds me of kind of a reason I think my path was a bit like not direct and zigzagged. because in the UK you can you choose to study 11 subjects up until the age of 16, and then you only study four from 16 to 18. and then at university you generally just study one. and what's more the 11 subjects that you choose to finish when you're 16, you choose them when you're 13. so it is really really narrow in terms of what you can study because yeah pretty much if you don't study... if you don't choose to study geography when you are 13 years old you cannot study it at university which is crazy because you're 13 years old how do you know. so one interesting thing when I was thinking about what I chose to study is that I when I was 13, I chose to study French and then when I was 16, I chose to continue studying French and then actually I ended up in montreal where my French got really good. and then the first time I was actually in france which was after I was in montreal because I'd never been to france before. I just say that because I studied French because I liked it not because I was the best at it but because I liked it. and that kind of led me to montreal and then kind of led me where I am now. so I really think you should study what you want to study. it's not always about studying what you are the best at but study what is fun. I think that's really important. and yeah I think I was very fortunate looking back because I didn't have anybody who directly told me to my face that I couldn't do something. yeah and that doesn't mean that representation isn't important because I never aspired to be many things because I just didn't know they existed, but I was very fortunate that I didn't have people around me who were too insecure in themselves and then decided to try to limit my possibilities because of this. I think now in in the digital age so that there are so many more resources on the internet and so many websites you can read, where people create blogs and stuff like this. I would definitely give the advice to a younger person that if you want to do something you can look into it, you can find the people online, you can find the websites online to to learn different things and to learn different tips. and I think that definitely the way to go is to do what is is fun, and do what you want.
very true thank you. you touched on one very specific thing in the beginning which I also find detrimental to young people, is limiting you know their exposure to certain topics and information. so I feel one thing we should look at and that's obviously not our thing to do but definitely the education system should be as broad as possible so everybody gets a chance to to dabble in different topics and look at them. because obviously 13 years is much too young to actually decide whether you will like something in the future or not.
Actually when I was 12 I could choose between German and Spanish and I chose German because then I got to visit Germany. and then when I was 13 I decided to go for French but now I'm fluent in both [French and German] so it worked its way out.
yeah luckily yeah but you never know right where life will take you if it will be German or French or something completely different that will be useful you know. and then the second thing that makes me thoughtful is that you said you were lucky because nobody discouraged you from doing what you're doing and the same is true for me. and that is probably the reason why I was able to go the path I did. but that's a sad thing actually you know that you have to be happy that at least nobody said don't do it you're not good enough. and you don't have the role models and you don't have the you know the the lift that you might need to go higher places. I think that's something we can do for others you know telling them that they are definitely good, you know good enough to choose a career in I.T. or in science and they will make it. so that's something I feel we should all try to do. and thank you for coming on my interview thank you for taking the time it was lovely just chatting with you thank you and goodbye.
thank you, bye.
