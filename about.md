<h3>Jillian Augustine, PhD.</h3>
I am a data scientist and question answerer. I received my PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Vienna (Austria) and my BSc from the University of Leeds (UK) during which I also studied at McGill University (Montreal, Canada).

My main interest (and the reason I became a data scientist) is using data to answer questions regardless of the industry. I have experience working in the telecommunications industry. In particular I am passionate about data understanding and communication both to stakeholders and within data teams. My professional approach to data science is to use the tool that gets the job done given any constraints from team members and stakeholders. 

Another interest of mine is increasing the inclusivity of working groups through open exchanges and active diversificartion. I try to make my presentations are accessible as possible and welcome feedback as to how I can improve this further. I welcome opportunities to speak about my work at conferences and meetups.
